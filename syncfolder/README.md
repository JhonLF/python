# Directory Synchronization Script

This Python script provides a robust solution for one-way directory synchronization. It is designed to ensure that the content of a replica folder is an exact mirror of the source folder after each synchronization cycle. The 
tool operates periodically, as defined by the user, and meticulously logs all file creation, copying, and removal operations both to a specified log file and to the console output.
